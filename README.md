**Will try and update to 1.1 sometime this month when I find time, I do not plan on getting the Royal DLC so support for that is not guaranteed.** 

# Makes colonists and prisoners milkable using a drug. 

Craft Lact-X at the Drug Lab
Craft Lact-MAX at the Drug Lab for permanent lactation
Compatible with pregnancy mods
Modifiers for mod that adds breast sizes
Does not work on animals.

# Safe to add to saves
 (A new drug policy is required for it to add Lact-X)

# FAQ

# Q.
 <ins>What the fuck?</ins>
# A.
 Randy made me do it under threat of manhunting squirrels.

# Mod races supported
 (Let me know if you want a race added)
<ins>If you think a race should produce something other than milk let me know!</ins>
I have now figured out how to add conditional patches to allow for items from other mods to be added as a milkable produce, so items from other mods that aren&apos;t in the parent mod are now fair game.
